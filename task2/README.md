## Detailed Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **Authentication Vulnerabilities**
   - Login endpoint analysis revealed potential weaknesses
   - HTTP 401 responses indicate authentication failures
   - Session management requires further investigation

2. **Network Security**
   - CORS headers present: `access-control-allow-origin: *`
   - Content-Type: `text/html; charset=utf-8`
   - Response size: 923 B (26 B compressed)

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Login endpoint: `/rest/user/login`
   - Request method: POST
   - Status codes: 401 (Unauthorized)

### Security Headers Observed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Strengthen Authentication**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Use secure password policies

2. **Improve Security Headers**
   - Restrict CORS policy (avoid wildcards)
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Add X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options

3. **Session Management**
   - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies
   - Implement proper session timeout mechanisms
   - Generate cryptographically secure session tokens

### Long-term Improvements

1. Regular security audits
2. Implementation of Web Application Firewall (WAF)
3. Security awareness training for developers
4. Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
