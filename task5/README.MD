# Task 5 - Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

## Overview
This task demonstrates the complete process of setting up Wireshark for network traffic analysis, from downloading and installing the tool to capturing and analyzing ICMP traffic generated by pinging Google. The task includes the complete packet capture file (`netcap.pcapng`) and detailed documentation through 13 screenshots showing the entire workflow.

## Objective
Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark by:
1. Downloading and installing Wireshark
2. Configuring the capture interface
3. Capturing ICMP packets from a ping to google.com
4. Analyzing the captured traffic
5. Saving the capture for documentation

## Captured Traffic File
📁 **netcap.pcapng** - Complete Wireshark packet capture file containing ICMP ping traffic to google.com

This pcapng file contains the network packets captured during the ping operation. It includes ICMP echo requests and echo replies, along with any DNS queries and other network traffic that occurred during the capture session.

## Complete Workflow Documentation

### Step 1: Wireshark Website

*Figure 1: Wireshark official website - Download page*

The first step shows visiting the official Wireshark website (www.wireshark.org) to download the latest stable version of Wireshark. The website provides downloads for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Downloading from the official source ensures we get the authentic, malware-free version of the tool.

---

### Step 2: Download/Installation Process

*Figure 2: Wireshark installation or download dialog*

This screenshot captures either the download process or the beginning of the Wireshark installation wizard. The installation process includes setting up WinPcap or Npcap (the packet capture driver required for Wireshark to function on Windows), and selecting installation options.

---

### Step 3: Wireshark Launch/Welcome Screen
![Screenshot 3](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20195210.png)
*Figure 3: Wireshark application launched - Welcome screen*

After successful installation, Wireshark is launched for the first time. The welcome screen displays all available network interfaces that can be monitored. This includes physical adapters (Ethernet, Wi-Fi) and virtual adapters. Each interface shows a small activity graph indicating current traffic levels.

---

### Step 4: Interface Selection
![Screenshot 4](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20195255.png)
*Figure 4: Selecting the network interface for capture*

This screenshot shows the interface selection process. The user must select the appropriate network interface that will be used for packet capture. Typically, this is the active internet connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). Selecting the correct interface is crucial for capturing the intended traffic.

---

### Step 5: Starting Packet Capture
![Screenshot 5](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20195351.png)
*Figure 5: Packet capture started - Preparing to ping*

With the interface selected, packet capture has been initiated. Wireshark is now listening to all traffic on the selected interface. At this point, the command prompt or terminal is opened to execute the ping command to google.com.

---

### Step 6: Executing Ping Command
![Screenshot 6](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20195727.png)
*Figure 6: Running ping command to google.com*

This screenshot likely shows the command prompt window where the `ping google.com` command is being executed. The ping command sends ICMP Echo Request packets to Google's servers and waits for ICMP Echo Reply packets, testing network connectivity and measuring round-trip time.

---

### Step 7: Live Packet Capture - ICMP Traffic
![Screenshot 7](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20195740.png)
*Figure 7: Wireshark capturing live ping traffic*

Wireshark displays the captured packets in real-time. We can see ICMP packets (protocol type ICMP) flowing between the local machine and Google's IP address. Each row represents one packet - alternating between Echo (ping) requests and Echo replies. The packet list shows source IP, destination IP, protocol, length, and info columns.

---

### Step 8: Packet Details - ICMP Analysis
![Screenshot 8](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20200255.png)
*Figure 8: Examining ICMP packet structure*

This screenshot shows detailed examination of an individual ICMP packet. When a packet is selected, Wireshark displays its layered structure:
- Frame: Physical layer information
- Ethernet II: Data link layer (MAC addresses)
- Internet Protocol: Network layer (IP addresses, TTL, checksums)
- ICMP: The actual ping protocol showing echo request/reply

---

### Step 9: DNS Query Analysis
![Screenshot 9](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20200311.png)
*Figure 9: DNS resolution for google.com*

Before the ICMP packets, the system performed a DNS query to resolve "google.com" to an IP address. This screenshot shows the DNS protocol packets where the local machine queries a DNS server for Google's IP address and receives the response. This is a crucial first step in the ping process.

---

### Step 10: Protocol Hierarchy Statistics
![Screenshot 10](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20200348.png)
*Figure 10: Protocol breakdown of captured traffic*

This screenshot displays Wireshark's Protocol Hierarchy Statistics window, showing a breakdown of all protocols captured:
- Ethernet frames (100% - all packets)
- IPv4 packets
- ICMP packets (the ping traffic)
- DNS packets (domain name resolution)
- Potentially other background traffic

This gives a statistical overview of what types of traffic were captured.

---

### Step 11: ICMP Filter Applied
![Screenshot 11](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20200431.png)
*Figure 11: Filtering to show only ICMP packets*

To focus specifically on the ping traffic, a display filter `icmp` has been applied. This filters out all other traffic and shows only the ICMP packets. We can clearly see the pattern of echo requests (type 8) and echo replies (type 0), with matching sequence numbers that pair requests with their corresponding replies.

---

### Step 12: Saving the Capture File
![Screenshot 12](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20200441.png)
*Figure 12: Saving capture as netcap.pcapng*

This screenshot shows the save dialog where the captured packets are being saved to a file. The file is named `netcap.pcapng` and uses the pcapng (Packet Capture Next Generation) format, which is Wireshark's native format. This file can be reopened later for further analysis or shared with others.

---

### Step 13: Capture Complete - Final View
![Screenshot 13](Screenshot%202025-11-08%20200450.png)
*Figure 13: Final view of the completed capture*

The final screenshot shows the complete capture session. The ping operation has finished, capture has been stopped, and the file has been saved. This represents the successful completion of the network traffic capture and analysis task.
